;; Sequences

;; If you have an existing buffer you want to destructively read into, you can use read-sequence.

(let ((dest (make-list 5)))
    (read-sequence dest *standard-input*)
    dest)
abcde
;; (#\a #\b #\c #\d #\e)
;; This procedure won't read more input than can fit into the buffer you specify.

(let ((dest (make-list 3)))
    (read-sequence dest *standard-input*)
    dest)
abcdefghi
;; (#\a #\b #\c)

(let ((dest (list)))
    (read-sequence dest *standard-input*)
    dest)
NIL
;; Note that it doesn't even wait for input when given a zero-length buffer. 
;; It will also keep reading until the buffer is filledâ€¦

;; As you can see from the above examples, the return value of read-sequence is 
;; the number of stream elements it consumed, and it really is a destructive update on the specified buffer.

;; The buffer can be of any sequence type, rather than just a list.
